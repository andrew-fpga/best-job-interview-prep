From a very early age I've been a problem solver. I was that kid who would take apart anything so I could see how it workedâ€”and then try to put it back together. As you can imagine, it drove my parents nuts. But even though I tortured my family at times, the tinkering trait has served me well in my career. After graduating from Purdue, I was recruited into a field technician job and got paid to take apart broken packaging equipment. It was like living the dream. That job also made me realize I'm really good with difficult customers, and that's what helped me land my current account manager role. While I love my job and have been successful in it, it has moved me away from the manufacturing floor. Now, the reason I'm so interested in this position is that it seems to provide a really great blend of one-on-one work with clients and hands-on problem solving.
