I've got both the experience and target audience rapport that you're looking for. I've built two corporate training programs from scratch and developed the kind of interactive video programs that you're looking to create. When employees fill out feedback forms, they speak highly of my professionalism and clarity that they've encountered. Here’s a quick example. A close friend of mine on your marketing team says that this company is a great cultural fit given my background and values. I have an insatiable level of curiosity and tend to do lots of research on any topic that I'm less than an expert in. And I know your values include constant learning. That really resonates with my passion. I'm just eager to become part of a fast-growing, mission-oriented organization like yours.

As a data scientist, I’ve demonstrated my ability to answer business questions, as well as advise strategic marketing decisions by providing in-depth data analysis with various technical skills, such as SQL and R. Part of my role has been to evaluate a $30M marketing budget and make recommendations. A recent marketing strategy that I proposed eventually drove growth of 10% for the business. I am also proactive in learning new skills. For example, knowing that effective communication is the key to making findings convincing, I sought out and took training sessions on both data visualization and presentation. These skill sets have been critical in successfully pitching and persuading senior leadership on changes to strategy. As a result, I was quickly promoted to a senior role in just a year.

My resume demonstrates that I’ve been successful with the key responsibilities of this role: managing teams, developing strategic sales plans, and delivering quarterly targets. I’ve been managing teams for the last 10 years and to this day, many of my former direct reports still call and ask for career or personal advice. I’ve also led the development of strategic plans with the customer for years. I first listen and understand their priorities and objectives, then develop a win-win solution for both parties. Last year my team received 2 awards. The first was from our internal organization for collaboration and partnership in developing our 3-year plans. The second was the Vendor of The Year Award from the customer for putting together plans that exceeded their growth targets. I’ve been in sales for the last 15 years and I know how important it is to hit targets — it’s the lifeblood of what we do. That’s why I work hard to support and guide my team, as well as work with internal partners to anticipate and remove roadblocks. I believe I would be a great fit for this role as I already have relevant experience and been successful in my previous roles.
